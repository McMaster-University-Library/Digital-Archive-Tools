Street names still in use today are: ""Peter St."", ""William St."", ""Douglas Pl."", ""Edward St."", ""Mill St."", and ""Louisa St."" Freelton was originally laid out by Irish immigrant Patrick Freel (1817-1884) who owned over 100 acres. Freel was an innkeeper, miller, insurance agent, and Justice of the Peace. Freel and his wife Elizabeth were buried in the cemetery of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in Freelton."

Rolph has a small street named after him in Dundas (found approximately where Macnab St. is shown on this map). Rolph served as a lieutenant in the War of 1812 and he was the brother of well known Reformer and physician Dr. John Rolph (1793-1870). Upon settling in Dundas he took up a position as the first clerk of the peace in the Gore District. He also built a house at 43 Cross Street (currently the oldest standing home in Dundas). Rolph aligned himself with Reformers such as William Lyon Mackenzie which, along with his marital infidelity, led him to be tarred and feathered at the hands of a mob of Tories (including Allan N. MacNab). Before he died, MacNab managed to ascertain and relocate Rolph's property gates which now stand on the premises of Dundurn Castle (known as the Rolph Gates).   Thomas Howard McKenzie (1811-?) was a mapmaker, merchant, explorer, and politician in Dundas. He came to Canada from Scotland in 1830, began as a clerk for then mayor Colin Ferrie.

The streets listed are: East Avenue, Centre Avenue, West Avenue, Willson Street [named after the Willson family], Concession Street, Ontario Street, Railway Street, and Elizabeth Street [named for the wife of Hon. John Willson]. Today, East Avenue is now East Street (in a section north of the QEW), Centre Avenue is now Winona Road, and West Avenue is still West Avenue (in a small section south of the QEW). All other streets are no longer in existence. In both top corners are the words ""Book 3, Plan 11"". The map outlines a number of buildings and named lots. Just south of the railroad tracks is the ""Depot G.W.R."" [Great Western Railway]. Along the shoreline, near the pier [which was built by Wilson], are found a hotel and three large lots owned by ""W.P. McLaren, Esqr"", ""Hon. John Willson"", and ""J.W. Willson"". William Patterson McLaren (1810-1866) was a well-known Scottish businessman, philanthropist and politician who settled in Saltfleet Township. He served as Chairman on the Board of Directors for the Great Western Railroad Company and on the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. He was also well-known for his hobby of fruit farming. McLaren's peaches were even hailed by the famous landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing (1815-1852) in his journal The Horticulturalist. Hon. John Willson (1776-1860) was a New Jersey-born loyalist who served in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. He was the Speaker of the Assembly from 1825-1828 and he was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1839. He was also a justice of the peace in the Gore District and a judge in the district court. Lastly, (J.W.) John Wesley Willson (1819-1889) was the son of John Willson. The former home of John Wesley became the well-known Winona Park Hotel, an idyllic destination for the passengers of the nearby railway. It is unclear whether the ""hotel"" depicted in lots 45-47 in the plan is the Winona Park Hotel or if it is the ""Lake House"" which is illustrated in great detail atop the map. The ""Lake House"" was the work of listed architect ""W. Boultbee"" [William Boultbee (1832-1902)]. It is a late Georgian-Italiante structure. The scale of the building is listed as ""12 ft to an Inch"" [1:144]. It is worth mentioning that the Willson family continued to live in this area for many subsequent years. The 1875 Wentworth County Atlas, for example, shows both ""A.B. Wilson"" and ""J.W. Wilson"" in the vicinity of Winona, Ontario (Lots 4-5, Concession BF-1). Much of the land drawn on the map is now residential property today, though the area also includes the John Willson Park and Liuna Gardens."

The entire profile spans approximately 3.35 kilometres or 2 miles. It appears as if it covers approximately lots 26 to 32 in the Broken Front Concession (from Burgess Avenue to Centennial Parkway, along the waterfront). Sources indicate that the diagram's author, Joseph Hobson, was a well known surveyor and engineer. Born in England, Hobson contributed to the profession by designing bridges and railway spans in Montreal, Sarnia, Niagara, Bruce County, Ohio, Michigan, and Nova Scotia.

The town of Binbrook  [known as Hall's Corners prior to 1875] is located between Concessions 3 and 4, block #11. In 1791, the concessions were numbered and divided into five blocks each, numbered east to west. Each 1000 acre block was subdivided into 200-acre single front lots. The exception was Block 5 (along the western edge), which contained only 600 acres of land and it was divided into three 200 acre lots. Additional lands located south of Concession 4 (Concesssions 7-10) were incorporated into the township in 1800.

The map shows the properties of Peter Gage (15 acres) and William Gage (20 acres) and part of the estate of the late William Blaikie. Along the northern road the map depicts [now approximately Brampton Road] there are a number of landmarks listed: ""stone monument & oak tree"", ""white oak tree"", ""hickory tree"", and another ""stone monument"". This map features no scale or directional arrow. In the top left corner are found the numbers ""200"" with a strike through it and ""No 96, Drawer No 1"". The plan focuses on the estate lands of the late William Blaikie. The 1852 Canada West Census shows that a Scottish-born William Blaikie as a 51 year old Presbyterian living in Saltfleet and working as a farmer. According to the land record books at the Stoney Creek Historical Society, Blaikie was first cited as buying lots 29-31 in Concession 1 in either 1834 or 1837. Blaikie is shown to still own some land in this location on the 1859 Map of Wentworth County by Robert Surtees though part of his land was deeded to the Great Western Railway in 1852 [likely just south of the area shown in this plan] and other lots appear to be sold between 1858-1861. The map highlights the land of two Gages: Peter (1804-1869) and William (1801–1888). Peter and William also had a brother Andrew Gage (1824-1893) who was listed as purchasing land in 1858. It is likely that this Andrew had in fact purchased the subdivided survey lots in question from Blaikie. These Gages were the grandchildren of settler William Gage (1744-1820) who came to Saltfleet from Ireland via New York and was granted 600 acres of land in 1790. Part of William's farm was used as the site of the 1813 Battle of Stoney Creek and his farmhouse was used by both British and American military personnel during the war."

On the right hand side of the map there is an inset showing a larger view of Concessions 5 and 6 with a note on geographical bearings by surveyor John Stoughton Dennis (1820-1885). Dennis was a well-known surveyor and military commander whose ancestors served in both the War of 1812 and the American Revolutionary War. Dennis worked on surveys for the Grand Trunk and Great Western Railways as well as plans for numerous Upper Canadian towns and townships including: Weston, Muskoka, Haliburton, Parry Sound, Nipissing, and the Bruce Peninsula. He was also credited with completing the surveying for the well-known 1851 ""Topographical Plan of the City of Toronto"". Through his social status Dennis managed to insert himself into the Canadian military and in 1856 he was made commander of the Toronto Field Battery. In 1862 he was promoted as the new leading officer in the 5th Military District as Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1866 Stoughton was involved in leading contingents in the Battles of Ridgeway and Niagara against the Fenians. He was criticized for abandoning his men in a Fenian attack which resulted in 34 lost lives, effectively ending his military career. Dennis also was made famous for his involvement in helping to trigger he 1869 Red River Rebellion. His confrontational surveying methods led to disdain and uprising among the Manitoba Métis. Stoughton had a son, J.S. Dennis Jr., who also became a prominent surveyor and military officer. Stoughton died in July of 1885.

The outline of lots corresponds to the same location of other maps in our collection: RMC 7572 and RMC 7573. The map does not include a title, scale, author, or directional arrow. The map is oriented so that lot numbers are written north-to-south and writing and labeling is written south-to-north. The Great Western Railway tracks are shown at the top of the map (the southern boundary) and the waterfront is shown at the bottom of the map (the northern boundary). There are no street names listed on the plan but the north-south running streets correspond approximately with East Street, Winona Road, and Lido Drive.  The east-west running streets correspond approximately with North Service Road (""Baseline of first Concession"") and Winona Park Road (""This Street…about 850 to 900 feet from the Lake…"").  Atop the map is written ""The village lots marked thus X…"" and there are numerous X's penciled on various lots on the plan. There are other marking on the map including ""Hon. J. Willson"" in lot 46 and ""J.W. Willson"" in lot 49. These locations, including the barn drawn in lot 25, are consistent with the locations of the property of the Willson family as found in the ""Plan of Ontario"" (RMC 7572) and the 1875 Wentworth County Atlas (the family name is sometimes written as ""Willson"" and other times as ""Wilson""). For more information on John Wesley Willson (1819-1889) and Hon. John Willson (1776-1860), see ""Plan of Ontario"" (RMC 7572).  Adjacent to these lots is lot 69 atop of which is written the following: ""This lot is to be reserved for Capt [Mafren?]"". Along the north shore is an object which appears to be a pier jutting out into the lake. Next to the drawing it reads ""Pier to be about [?] rods wide"". Another possibility based on the appearance of the calligraphy is that the word is actually ""weir"" which is a dam across a waterway which alters its flow.  The map also features descriptive writing along the right side and at the base of the map. Along the right side is written ""J.W. Willson to have 5 acres with house [,] barn"". At the base of the map is a paragraph of writing which is largely illegible, though some words can be deciphered: ""Mr Blyth will please us…in buying out the property…Lake or water lots to be about 90 to 100 feet…250 deep as they may angle…the other village lots…not over 1¾ acres each.  Here John Willson to have… "" The ""Mr. Blyth"" mentioned in the paragraph was likely Thomas Allen Blyth, P.L.S., a well recognized local land surveyor who also laid out the corresponding ""Plan of Ontario"" (RMC 7572)."

Surveyed for the utility requirements of the Board of Water Commissioners for the City of Hamilton. The scale is found below the title: ""400 feet to an inch"". There is no date or directional arrow included on the map. In bottom left hand corner is written ""No 98 Drawer 3 Burlington Beach"" and the number ""184"" encircled. The map is oriented so that north is at the base of the map along with Lake Ontario and Burlington Bay. There are a number of utilities and infrastructure featured on the map including is a ""pumping main"" which cuts across the survey and connects to an ""engine house"" and a ""filtering basin"" along Burlington Beach. Also drawn along the beach is a ""road from Stony Creek"" which crosses the Windemere Basin and becomes ""the Beach Road"".  The Great Western Railway spans the top of the map (the southernmost boundary). The property owners listed on the map include: George Lottridge (lot 29), William and John Bates (east part of lot 31), Henry Waterberry (west part of lot 31), George Gant (lot 32), and Thomas Jones (lot 34). In terms of dating the map, we know that it was completed after the construction of the Great Western Railway (1854) and after the publication of the 1875 Wentworth County Atlas which lists many differing owners on these lots in years prior. Hamilton City Directories indicated that prior to 1881, not all of the above-named individuals were listed as owning property in Saltfleet. I have noted 1889 as the last possible date for the map; that is the year in which George Lottridge died. Given that Lottridge is shown as a property owner on the map, it cannot be any older."

71106	cartographic	"The map features no title, scale, directional arrow, or author/publisher. The location of the map is in the north end, just south of Bayfront Park. It fits within Lot 15, Concession 1 of the former Township of Barton. The area is still industrial today. In the top left hand corner of the map it is numbered: ""No 125 Drawer 6"". The streets listed on the map include ""Stuart Street"", ""Caroline"", and ""Hess"" Streets. Each of these streets are in existence today. The map is oriented in an upside down format so that north is at the bottom of the map. Just off the left side of the map (east) is Tiffany Street and just off the top edge of the map (south) is Barton Street. The location of Stuart Street's diagonal path (as found today) can be seen on the right side of the map. Maps of the middle part of the 19th century indicate the additional street within the boundaries of this map is ""Eliza Street"" (between Hess and Caroline).  Just north of Stuart Street is the CN/Southern Ontario Railway yard (formerly the Great Western Railway). Within the survey are 23 narrow lots (each 23-24 feet wide) and two larger industrial lots. One is listed as ""Tool Company property"" and the other ""Gartshore"". John Gartshore (1810-1873) was one of the leading manufacturers in the country during the 19th century. He moved to Canada from Scotland in 1829 and after a fire destroyed his flour mill in Fergus, Ontario he moved on to Dundas. There he built a foundry in 1838 with James Bell Ewart and manufactured steam engines, mill machinery, and parts for the Great Western Railway. Between 1857 and 1859, Gartshore cast the boilers and beam engines for the Hamilton waterworks found in the Hamilton Museum of Steam and Technology today. In 1870, the foundry was sold to a local apprentice Thomas Wilson (Houghton, Margaret. Hamilton Street Names. Toronto: James Lorimer & Co., Ltd., Publishers, 2002). John's son Alexander Gartshore (1839-1904) moved his industrial efforts to Hamilton and formed a partnership under the name Gartshore & Cowie, acting as the first iron pipe manufacturer in Ontario. Alexander Gartshore soon acquired full control of the foundry (Cochrane, William. The Canadian Album: Men of Canada. Vol. 1. Brantford: Bradley, Garretson, 1891.) This was likely the earliest period in which the survey may have been drawn. The company was eventually named the Canada Pipe Foundry and subsequently the Gartshore-Thompson Pipe & Foundry Company. These cast iron pipes connected Hamiltonians with water, sewer and gas lines and helped to build the infrastructure of the city. The company was purchased by Canada Iron Foundries in 1939 (Gartshore Ian and Sandra (Gartshore) Jernigan. An Engineering Entrepreneur in Early Canada: John Gartshore in the 1800s. Kingston, The Engineering Institute of Canada, 2003). In nearby Pier 4 Park on Macassa Bay is found the Gartshore-Thompson Building (ca. 1900), a relocated historic building that once acted as the offices for the Gartshore-Thompson Pipe & Foundry Company. The ""Tool Company property"" shown on the map was the Hamilton Tool Works Company founded by William Hendrie in 1872. The Hamilton City Directory from 1874 shows the company as being located on Caroline and Stuart Streets. In 1881, the company was reorganized as the Hamilton Bridge and Tool Company (Burely, David. William Hendrie: The Dictionary of Canadian Biography, online edition, 2015). Due to its proximity to the rail line, the company started making railway bridges and was renamed the Hamilton Bridge and Tool Works and then again the Hamilton Bridge Works Company Limited (H.B.W.) in 1894. (Hamilton Special Collections. Industrial Hamilton: The Trail to the Future, Hamilton Public Library, 2001). Among the many bridges built by the company, two include the railway swing bridge over the Burlington Canal and the Prince Edward Viaduct truss bridge in Toronto. The company was prolific in bridge manufacturing not only in Hamilton but also across Ontario. According a study of bridges in the Region of Waterloo ""Almost every steel bridge that exists or existed in Waterloo Region was built by this company or its predecessors"" (Fontaine, Mike. Spanning the Generation: A Study of Old Bridges in Waterloo Region. Waterloo: Waterloo Planning and Community Services, 2004). The company remained in existence, under various names, at Stuart and Caroline Streets until 1962. Regarding the smaller, adjacent lots on the survey, the Hamilton City Directories of the 1800s indicate that the area was filled with industrial workers. The directory of 1869, for example, lists blacksmiths, machinists, labourers, carpenters, and engine drivers as property owners and tenants. There are, as well, a number of vacant lots in the vicinity during this time period."		http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3	http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3	http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink	http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance	[Sketch of survey of industrial property at Stuart and Hess streets]	1870	[between 1870 and 1881]	eng	map	Scale not given	"1 map : 25 x 57 cm.

71172	cartographic	"The map is a plan for an early subdivision in east Hamilton, in the McQuesten and Normanhurst neighbourhoods (the former Township of Saltfleet).  The map is of the same style as other plans in our collection created by J.W. Tyrell and J.J. MacKay. The map features a directional arrow found in the top left corner and a scale found directly underneath the title; ""100 feet = 1 inch"". The map is dated and certified by the land surveyor along the right margin: ""May 1, 1913"". There are numerous other signatures and approvals by the Registry Office, the Commissioner, the mayor, the reeve, the clerk, the developer, witnesses, mortgagees, and the Ontario Railway & Municipal Board.  There is also an embossed seal of approval by the developer ""Wilson Park Limited Hamilton Ont.""  Above the legal writing is found an inset key plan showing the location of the proposed development as part of lot 32, concession 2. The streets listed on the map include ""Roxborough Avenue"", ""Britannia Avenue"", ""Barton Street"", ""Adeline Avenue"", ""Glennie Avenue"", ""Parkdale Avenue"", and ""Ivon Avenue"". Other features on the map include labelled adjacent properties: ""Normanhurst Survey"", ""Lands of Catherine Harris"", and ""Lands of Broadbent"". The 1875 Wentworth County Atlas shows a ""Miss K. Harris"" owning area around lot 32, concession 2.  The name of the plan ""Wilson Park"" is likely a tribute to Hon. John Willson (1776-1860) or John Wesley Willson (1819-1889). The surname ""Willson"" is also often found as ""Wilson"". For more information on the Wilsons, see the ""Plan of Ontario"". It appears as though the area on the map was annexed by the City of Hamilton (from the Township of Saltfleet) in 1943 (John Weaver, Hamilton: An Illustrated History. Toronto: James Lorimer & Company Publishers, 1982).  The map was surveyed by Edwin Percy Argall Phillips, O.L.S. (1884-1970). Phillips was born in Oshawa, educated in Toronto, and trained as an engineer and surveyor in Bracebridge, Ontario.   Phillips played an extensive role in the surveying and development of northern Ontario. Biographical accounts indicate that Phillips only spent two years surveying in Hamilton (1912-13) before returning to work in northern Ontario (P.R. Milton and T.L. Wilson, Edwin Percy Argall Phillips, BSc., O.L.S., D.L.S., P.Eng., M.E.I.C.. Toronto: AOLS Report of the Committee on Biography & Repository, posted in 2013). The company responsible for publishing and certifying the plan was J.J. MacKay & Co., Engineers & Surveyors. James John MacKay, O.L.S. (1876-1959) was a land surveyor originally from Zorra Township. In 1902, MacKay joined with J.W. Tyrell, O.L.S as a partner in Hamilton. In 1912 he formed his own engineering-surveying firm with his brother Col. E.G. MacKay and was joined by Edwin P.A. Phillips later that year (Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, John James MacKay, O.L.S., P.Eng. Toronto: AOLS Report of the Committee on Biography & Repository, posted in 2013). MacKay served as the chairman of the Hamilton Suburban Roads Commission and was involved in laying the nation's first concrete road from Toronto to Hamilton, now the Queen Elizabeth Way (John Sewell, The Shape of the Suburbs: Understanding Toronto's Sprawl. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009). MacKay's company undertook thousands of area surveys and plans, including two others in our collection: ""Plan of Kenview Park"" and ""Plan showing resubdivision of lots nos. 104 to 112 Allen & Matheson Survey""."

71279	cartographic	"This map depicts 41.5 acres of land subdivided into blocks and lots. It is located at the intersection of King and Dundurn Streets, in the Strathcona neighbourhood (lot 19, concession 2). Along the left side of the map is the title ""Sketch of part of lot no.19 containing 41 1/2 acres"". There is no author, date, or directional arrow listed on the map. Directionally, north would be pointing toward the right edge of the map. Just below the title is listed the scale ""2ch to one Inch"". In the top left-hand corner the map it is numbered: ""No 47 Drawer No 2"". The streets shown are unmarked but they are King Street (running east-west) and Dundurn Street (running north-south). There are 130 individual lots depicted on the sketch within 10 blocks. There is also, along King Street, a ""Brick Yard"" and a large property belonging to ""Captn. Stewart"". At the top of the map (eastward) is open space, shown as ""54 acres"". Local historical maps show that this area was largely natural land, on higher elevation. The 1850-51 Map of the City of Hamilton by Marcus Smith confirms the location of this map and shows this a small portion of this land becoming a ""Catholic Cemetery"" [now the location of the Cathedral Basilica of Christ the King] and the rest as undeveloped land belonging to ""the honorable Malcolm Cameron"" (1808-1876). The Marcus Smith map also includes a ""Capt. Stuart"" as an individual owning land in the same location as the sketch. It is unclear as to which Captain Stuart/Stewart the map refers. One possibility is that it is well-known abolitionist and former military officer Captain Charles Stuart (1783-1863) who immigrated to Upper Canada in 1817 and settled in Amherstburg. We know that he was in the region during this period,  because he assisted in the formation of the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada at Toronto in February 1851 (Simpson, Donald. ""Stuart, Charles"" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, accessed May 1, 2015). Other options come from the Hamilton City Directories: in 1853 there is a Stuart listed as the clerk for the district court on King Street West. In 1880 there is a John Stewart listed as an ""excise officer"" living on King Street. Finally, in 1886 there is an Alex Stewart listed as a mason and living on King Street West. In the centre of the verso of the map is found a signature ""Lot 19, Charles Bain, Esq"" as well as the number 133 encircled. In the top right-hand corner of the map is another mention of ""Charles Bain, Esq"". Very little seems to be written of Bain although some sources indicate he was an assistant surveyor for the Grand River Navigation Company. He worked as an understudy to Marcus Blair of Hamilton who was the area's senior deputy surveyor and Warden of the Forest on the Grand River (Hill, Bruce Emerson. The Grand River Navigation Company. Brantford: Brant Service Press, 1994). Bain was deputized as the surveying assistant to Blair by the efforts of James Winniett (1777-1849), superintendent of the Indian Department. Both Bain and Blair dealt regularly with complaints, mistreatment, and illegal squatting on the Six Nations land surrounding the Grand River. In 1837 Bain was made Deputy Warden after the firing of Blair by Sir Francis B. Head (The Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, Appendix to the Sixth Volume of the Journals of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, Montreal: Steam Press, Rollo Campbell printer, 1847). By 1841, Bain was made Director of the Grand River Navigation Company. On behalf of the Grand River Navigation Company, Bain was likely involved in surveying and laying out plans for the villages of Paris, Indiana, of Oneida and Seneca [modern day Caledonia]."

On the verso some helpful information is given. Along with the word ""Plan"" and the number ""141"", it reads: ""Survey of J. Hopkins property in Flamborough East & West"".  This indicates that the property depicted was likely that of Joseph Hopkins (1748-1811) or one of his sons: John Kelsey Hopkins, Joseph Hopkins Jr., or James Hopkins. The former village of Hopkins Corners, located at the intersection of York Road and Valley Road, was named after the family. The family moved to Upper Canada in 1797 as Loyalists following the American Revolutionary War (Lee, Kevin. ""The Hopkins"" in Stoney Creek Historical Society Newsletter, ed.61, June 2014). According to the Wentworth County Atlas, by 1875, much of the land owned by the Hopkins' family had been sold to other property owners. There is a small piece of land owned by a ""J.Hopkins"" (either John Kelsey, James, or Joseph Jr.) at lot 28, concession 2 in West Flamborough. In East Flamborough there is a ""C.Hopkins"" (likely Caleb Hopkins) depicted as a property owner in lots 11 & 13, concession 2.  Also listed on the survey is the name Ezra Hopkins (1813-1851). In the 1852 Canada West Census Ezra Hopkins is listed as being a farmer, Wesleyan Methodist, and a resident of Flamboro West. On lot 28, concession 2 is found the Hopkins Family Cemetery today (also known as the Valley Cemetery). Many of the individuals mentioned above are buried there.

71311	cartographic	"This map shows a proposed plan for ""Kenview Park"" on the West mountain, at the border of the former Township of Ancaster and the Township of Barton in the current City of Hamilton. The plan's scale is listed under the title: ""Scale 200ft to 1 in"". The directional arrow is found on the right side of the map, pointing northwards. There are numerous signatory statements present on the map including those by owners, witnesses, mortgagees, clerks, registrar, reeve, mayor, surveyor, municipal commissioner, and chairman of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board. There is a key plan inset on the left side of the map showing the wider geographical area in which the plan is located. There are also three seals placed on the plan: two for the City of Hamilton and one for the Township of Ancaster (""Ancaster Township Municipality Incorporated 1850""). The streets laid for Kenview Park include: ""Redfearn Avenue"", ""Goulding  Avenue"", ""Gordon Avenue"", ""Brooks Avenue"", ""Gray Avenue"", ""Orton Avenue"", and ""Gore Avenue"". Outside of the survey, the plan includes ""Craigmore Drive"", ""Lonsdale Avenue"", ""Crescent Road"", ""Mountain Boulevard"", and ""Dunlop Avenue"".  Today there is very little to indicate that this plan was ever realized. Most of the streets in this location now follow a curvilinear design and nearly all (in this tract) were given names of Spanish/Hispanic origin. The homes in this neighbourhood are all new or built within the last 40 years (post-1970s). There are two streets drawn on the plan which do exist today, roughly in the same locations: Redfearn Avenue and Goulding Avenue. Running diagonally across the base of the survey is the ""Dominion Power and Transmission Co. Powerline"". Dominion Power was formed in 1907 (from the Hamilton Cataract Power, Light and Traction Company) and was the first company to bring hydro-electric power to Hamilton (Carolyn Gray, ""Business Structures and Records: The Dominion Power and Transmission Company, 1896-1930,"" in Archivaria 19:5 (1984): 151-161). The plan was produced by J.J. MacKay & Co., Engineers & Surveyors. More information on this company can be found by consulting RMC 7606/7 (""Plan of Wilson Park""). The surveyor of this plan was William Gourlay Webster (1884-1965). Webster was born in Toronto and educated as a civil engineer. He obtained his commission as an Ontario Land Surveyor in 1912 and began articling in Brantford. Gourlay completed the survey of Kenview Park in 1913, shortly before enlisting with the Canadian Engineers during the First World War. Webster went on to work as an MPP in the Ontario Legislature between 1943 and 1948 (S.W. Archibald, ""Hon. William Gourlay Webster, C.E., O.L.S,"" Toronto: Association of Ontario Land Surveyors Report of the Committee on Biography & Repository, posted in 2013). Also mentioned on the plan is John Allan (1856-1922) who was the mayor of the City of Hamilton between 1913-1914. Allan also went on to act as an MPP, his tenure between 1914-1919. This plan features a grid plan, typical of surveyors and planners of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Though this plan was never realized, its structured grid has been reproduced not only across the lower city but also across the mountain (David Premi and Paul Shaker, ""Mountain's History is Rich and Diverse"" in the Hamilton Spectator, May 7, 2015)."

71322	cartographic	"This is a survey for part of Abbotsford, a planned residential community on property owned by Lockart Duff (1793-1858). The survey is likely located in West Hamilton. The map has been surveyed by Thomas Allen Blyth, a well-known surveyor in the area during the 19th century. Blyth's signature found in the bottom right-hand corner ""ThS. Allen Blyth, P.L.S."" Below his signature the survey is dated ""Hamilton June 1854"". The scale is found at the base of the map ""Scale=2 Chains to 1 inch"" and the directional arrow is found along the left edge. In the bottom left-hand corner the map is numbered: ""No 62 Drawer 2"". The proposed streets listed are ""George Street"" [estimated to be approximately where Broadway Street is today], ""Lockart Street"" [estimated to be approximately where Bowman Street is today], and the ""Macadamized Road to Dundas"" [estimated to be approximately where Main Street West is today]. A macadamized road is a type of road construction invented in 1819 by engineer John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836). It involves layering small stones and coating them with a binder. Given the street names listed on the map it is unclear whether the plan was built as surveyed but it is clear that all of the roads listed were given new names. It is assumed that the ""George Street"" listed does not refer to the George Street located between King Street and Main Street in central Hamilton. Lockart Duff (sometimes spelled Lockhart) was a Scot who moved to Hamilton in 1830. He purchased 250 acres on the eastern edge of Dundas. In 1838 he built a ten-room stone house at the corner of Main and Broadway which he named ""Abbotsford Hall"" . The house was demolished in the 1950's. Today the site is home to a modern commercial plaza (opposite McMaster Hospital). Duff chose the name Abbotsford as a tribute to the former estate of his close friend, the famous novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott. Scott built his baronial mansion, Abbotsford, in the initial part of the 19th in the Scottish Borders. He is buried in Hamilton Cemetery. (Melville Bailey ed., ""Duff, Lockhart,"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, vol. 1. Hamilton: W.L. Griffin Limited, 1981).

71334	cartographic	"This is a small sketch map of the Corktown, Centremount & Stinson neighbourhoods, with the Niagara Escarpment featured prominently in the centre. The map does not have a title, date, author, publisher, or directional arrow listed. Its' orientation is such that it faces south. On the verso of the map it reads ""Part of the Blakie Estate"". It is unclear whether the author is referring to the lot owner being a ""Blaikie"" or ""Blakie"", presumably having misspelled the surname. It is possible that the author is referring to local landowner William Blaikie (see RMC 7610 ""Plan of survey of park lots in the Township of Saltfleet) or Scottish-born Toronto businessman John Lang Blaikie (1823-1912). The map itself is highly detailed, showcasing 19 lots as well as a number of some featured buildings. The streets listed are Wellington Street, John Street, ""proposed road"" [approximately Arkeldun Avenue], ""Concession Road & south limit of City of Hamilton"" [now Concession Street], and Charlton Avenue (street not labelled). The intersection of streets in this vicinity has been changed with the addition of multi-lane access collector roads: Jolley Cut, Claremont Access, and Sherman Access. Spanning the middle of the map is the escarpment with a quarry shown on its north side (or the ""Quarry Face of Mountain""). There is an ""Orphan Hospital"" drawn on Wellington Street at Charlton Avenue which is the original Hamilton Orphan Asylum (1848-1958). The orphanage was ""the first children's home to be established in the province...opened by the Ladies Benevolent Society of Hamilton in 1848,"" (Charlotte Neff, ""The Use of Apprenticeship and Adoption by the Toronto Protestant Orphans' Home, 1853-1869,"" Journal of Social History, Vol. 30, No 60, 1997). The orphanage was then expanded to offer care for elderly women in 1877 and closed down in 1914. It was eventually demolished in 1958 (Mark McNeil, ""The bygone era of Hamilton's orphanages"", The Hamilton Spectator, Nov. 14, 2014). Also north of the escarpment is land owned by ""Hiram Clarke's heirs"" and ""Dr. Roseburgh"". Dr. Roseburgh is listed on the 1875 Wentworth County Atlas as owning part of lots 13-14 in concession 3, Barton Township. Along the mountainside is shown ""McInne's house"". This is the famous Gothic Revival home known as ""Rock Castle"", located at 95 Arkledun Avenue. It was built by Alexander Carpenter (1806-1866) and was owned circa 1871-1882 by Hugh MacInnes and his wife Margaret Ann Carpenter. MacInnes was the brother of Donald MacInnes (1824-1900), the well-known Hamilton businessman and Conservative politician (Anne Marie Rajic, ""Rock Castle,"" L.A.C.A.C. Report, August 1980). South of the escarpment is found ""Belmont Terrace"" (likely a park and viewing platform), a series of lots, and the property of ""Colbeck"" including a house and a barn. South of the terrace it reads ""these lots belong to different...[indecipherable word]."" There is also a 1 acre lot owned by ""Dr. Craigie"". William Craigie (1799-1863) was a Scottish physician who emigrated to Ancaster in 1834 and moved to Hamilton in 1845 (Katherine Greenfield, Thomas Melville Bailey ed., Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, Vol. I 1791-1875. Hamilton: W.L. Griffin Ltd., 1981). Finally, in the south-east corner of the map is the ""Jolley house"", home of James Jolley (1813-1892). Jolley was a Scottish-born saddler and harnessmaker whose shop was on John Street South. In 1864 he moved to the Mountain and built a home he called ""Bellemont"" at the corner of Concession and East Fifteenth streets [now an apartment complex]. He was influential in the creation of a toll-free road from his home on the mountain to Rock Castle on John Street, known as the Jolley Cut, in 1873 (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, Vol. I 1791-1875.

On the verso of the map it is dated: ""[indecipherable word] subdivision of lots 13 to 22 inclusive Hon. J.H. Cameron survey 17 June 1856."" At the top of the map it is numbered: ""No 88 Drawer No 1"" and the number ""199"" is crossed out near the base of the map. The plan includes the following streets: Victoria Avenue, East Avenue, Emerald Street, Barton Street, and South Street [now Birge Street]. At the north boundary of the map (the right side) is the line of the Great Western Railway with a ""surface crossing"" at Victoria Avenue. The location of this map very closely resembles the location of RMC 7457 [Map of Barton and South Streets, Hamilton, Ontario]. The property owner of the lots depicted was John Hillyard Cameron (1817-1876); a lawyer, businessman, and Conservative politician. He was trained as a lawyer and was called to the bar in 1838, shortly after serving with the Queen's Rangers during the Rebellion of 1837-38. He entered politics in 1846, acting as an alderman in Toronto prior to joining the Executive Council of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. In the 1848 Canadian Almanac by Scobie & Balfour, Cameron was noted as being the Solicitor General for the Province. He served in the Legislative Assembly until Confederation and in 1867 was elected to represent Peel in the House of Commons (Library of Parliament, ""Cameron, John Hillyard, Q.C.,"" Parliament of Canada, accessed May 22, 2015). Throughout his life Cameron was highly involved in Upper Canadian high society. As well as being a lawyer and a politician, he served as a director of the Grand Trunk Railway, a solicitor for the Great Western Railway, and a part-owner of the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company. Cameron was also involved in insurance and helped to found the Canada Life Assurance Company in 1847.  Lastly, he served on the council of Trinity College (a Toronto Anglican university) where he also acted as a professor of law and served as chancellor from 1863 until his death (Donald Swainson, ""Cameron, John Hillyard,"" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 10, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003)."

The map was surveyed by Thomas Allen Blyth, his signature found at the base of the sketch: ""Ths. A. Blyth, P.L.S., Hamilton August [day] 1845."" Blyth was a prominent surveyor in Hamilton during the Victorian era, having done countless plans of the region (for more information on Blyth, see RMC 7609: ""Sketch of survey of lot 23 in the 4th Con. and lot 23 in the 5th Con., Saltfleet""). The plan's directional arrow is found in the top half of the map. Along its left edge is the word ""sketch"" and along its right edge is numbering ""No 45 Drawer 2"". The scale is found in the bottom left-hand corner: ""Scale 3c to an Inch"". On ther verso of the map there is also writing: ""Sketch of the Survey of part of no. 19 in the 2nd Conn of Barton"", ""Plans"", and ""ThS A. Blyth P.L.S., Hamilton, August 4, 1845"". The streets drawn are the ""original road allowance between nos. 18 and 19"" [now Dundurn Street], the ""road from Burlington Heights to Hamilton"" [now York Boulevard], and an unlabelled road [now Jones Street]. Of note on this map is the unusual configuration of York Boulevard, which was later altered for traffic safety purposes. This parcel of land is found at the westernmost extremity of Barton Township, sitting adjacent to Cootes Paradise. The line down the left side of the parcel reads ""this line between lot no. 19 in the Township of Barton & the Government Reserve."" The property owner, Sir Allen MacNab, was arguably the most influential Hamiltonian in the city's history. MacNab was a Canadian political leader, businessman, land speculator, lawyer, and soldier. He was a moderate Conservative who served as a Premier for the Province of Canada before Confederation (Peter Baskerville, ""MacNab, Sir Allen Napier"" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 9, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 1976). This map depicts the area just southwest of Dundurn Castle, the Italianate mansion constructed by MacNab in 1835. The map also encompasses Dundurn Park, Kay Drage Park, Hamilton Cemetery and the Chedoke Expressway."

The map's orientation is such that it faces east. This map includes 14 separate landowners on 4 concessions and 5 lot lines within the former jurisdiction of Barton Township. At the top-right extent of the map (the furthest east) is a hatched line indicating the boundary between Saltfleet Township. The map features a number of unlabelled roads. The following streets run north-south: Upper Kenilworth Avenue, Kenilworth Avenue, Upper Ottawa Street, and Ottawa Street. The following streets run east-west: Limeridge Road East, Mohawk Road East, Fennell Avenue East, Concession Street, King Street East, and Main Street East. Today, the area's arterial road network follows largely the same configuration, with the addition of access roads. Along the mountain brow there are a number of landowners shown with small parcels. Many of these names are unreadable. Those that are legible include"" Adam Condy, Thomas Best, H.C. Baker, David Crosthwaith [later written ""Crosthwaite""], and Jacob Burkholder. The largest landowners listed on the map (some owning entire lots), include: John Gage, William Mills, Thomas Waddell, and Abigail Gage.  John Gage (1819-1900) is listed as a farmer in the 1851 Census, owning Lot 1, Concession 3 in Barton Township. Gage married Hannah Cline in 1839. The 1851 Canada West Census also shows a William Mills as a 36-year old English-born merchant by trade and Wesleyan Methodist by religion. The 1871 Canada West Census lists a William Mills as a 60-year old ""gate keeper"" by trade and Wesleyan Methodist by religion. Another one of the landowners on the map is Thomas Waddell (1797-1859). Waddell was one of the earlier settlers in Wentworth County, marrying Mary Gage in 1825 and owning property in both Saltfleet and Barton Townships (""Waddell, Thomas"", Upper and Lower Canada Marriage Bonds, Library and Archives Canada, 2005). Lastly, landowner Abigail Gage (1823-1882) was married to Daniel Gage and was an inmate at the Hamilton Insane Asylum. She died at the age of 59 from tuberculosis. The inclusion of Gage's name on this map may give more strength to the idea that the map was drawn post-1859, the year Upper Canada passed legislation to grant married women certain property rights (the ""Act to Secure to Married Women Certain Rights of Property"")."

71374	cartographic	"This map is a layout for 70 building lots within the City of Hamilton, in the former Barton Township. The survey was done for land on the easternmost border of the city during this time. The map does not feature a publisher or directional arrow. Just below the title and surveyor signature is the date: ""Hamilton, April 1855."" Along the left-hand border it is numbered: ""No. 55 Drawer 6"". The streets depicted on the map include ""East Market St."" [now King William], ""King St. East"", ""Ashley St."", Steven Street [not labelled], and Nightingale Street [not labelled]. On East Market Street there is a building footprint for an ""intended marketplace"" which, based on subsequent maps, appears to never have been built. The land on the map divided into lots was the property of Thomas Stinson (1798-1864), a wealthy Hamilton landowner and subdivider. Along with his brothers John and Ebenezer, Thomas came to Canada from Ireland in 1826 and settled in Hamilton in 1830. The brothers began dealing dry-goods and groceries at the corner of King and John Streets, building the first brick business block in Hamilton (the Stinson Block) in 1837. Soon after Thomas entered real-estate and bought property across the city as well as in cities such Chicago and St. Paul. He also established himself as a banker, creating Stinson's Bank in 1847. There are numerous sites now named after the Stinson family including: Stinson Lofts, Stinson Street, the Stinson Block, and Stinson neighbourhood (T. Melville Bailey, ed., ""Stinson, Thomas,"" Dictionary of Hamilton Biography vol. I, Hamilton: W.L. Griffin Limited, 1981). The land surveyors for the lots in question were Robert Warren Kerr, P.L.S. (1810-1873) and Thomas Allen Blyth, P.L.S. (dates unknown). Kerr, who surveyed lots 1 to 42, was born in Ireland and settled in Dundas in 1832. He was trained as an engineer and became a lead engineer for the Desjardins Canal Company. Kerr also worked on the original section of the Grand Trunk Railway between Hamilton and Toronto. Kerr eventually became the City Engineer of Hamilton and subsequently City Chamberlain. He is known to have been involved in numerous local and regional surveys including land in Peel Township and the Township of Egremont. (S.C. Staveley Kerr, Colin W.G. Gibson, and Col. vanNostrand, ""Robert Warren Kerr and Francis Kerr,"" Toronto: Association of Ontario Land Surveyors Report of the Committee on Biography & Repository, posted in 2013). Thomas Allen Blyth, who surveyed lots 43 to 70, was an industrious surveyor of the city. Although he appears to have completed an impressive body of work, there is very little known about Blyth (some information can be found in the description of RMC 7609: ""Sketch of survey of lot 23 in the 4th Con. and lot 23 in the 5th Con., Saltfleet"")."

Just below the description are the words ""Copy [illegible signature] August 17 1872."" Not a great deal of information is available on McKenzie. He was a local surveyor during the 19th century and was responsible for the ""Plan of part of the tract of land belonging to the Six Nation Indians on the Hamilton and Port Dover Road"" (date unknown) as well as ""A Plan of the Town of Hamilton, Upper Canada"" (1836). He may have also been a member of Robert Bell's (1841-1917) geological survey group (Henri Pillon, ""Bell, Robert"" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 10, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 1976). There are numerous landowners listed on the map including the following names: ""William Fieley"", ""Tristram Bickle"", ""William Blaikie"", ""Hutchison Clarke"", and ""Aaron [illegible surname]"". Tristram Bickle (1801-1875) was a druggist born in Devonshire, England who immigrated to Canada in 1835 (Egerton Ryerson, ed., ""Biographical Sketches"", The Journal of Education for Ontario, vols. 27-28, 1875). Hutchison Clarke (1806-1877) (whose name spelling fluctuates) was an English-born architect and politician who moved to Hamilton in 1834. Clarke was responsible for designing the Mechanics' Institute on James Street North [now non-existent] as well as numerous other local buildings. He was involved in local government, representing St. Andrew's ward and serving as mayor in 1868. Interestingly, the Dictionary of Hamilton Biography notes that Clarke owned land matching the land outlined on the map and intended to use it for a ""pleasure-ground east of Wellington Street at the mountain.""  (Melville Bailey ed., ""Clark, Hutchinson"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, vol. 1. Hamilton: W.L. Griffin Limited, 1981) For more information on William Blaikie, see RMC 7610 (""Plan of survey of park lots in the Township of Saltfleet"".) No information was found on William Fieley or Aaron [illegible surname]. The streets drawn on the map are ""road allowance between lot 12 & 13"" [now Upper Wellington & Wellington Street], unnamed road between Concessions 3 & 4 [now Concession Street], and ""road 40 ft wide"" [now Charlton Avenue].

There are numerous buildings outlined on the map, most along Wellington Street. To the left of the title is a directional arrow, pointing to the right side of the map as north. Just below the title is the scale: ""scale, 2 chains per inch."" In the top left-hand corner the map is numbered: ""No. 102 Drawer 3."" In the bottom right-hand corner is found a date and signature by the surveyor: ""Stoughton Dennis, Prov. L. Surveyor, Toronto, July 29th 1856."" The main roads drawn on the plan include the following: Strongman Road [now approximately Claremont Access], ""4th Con. Road & south limits of city"" [now Concession Road], Wellington Street, and ""Main Street & 5th Con. Road"" [both have retained their names]. Unlisted on the map is Akledun Avenue. There are also a number of small urban streets intersecting with Wellington Street, north of the escarpment. These include: Tyburn Street, Peel Street, Mills Street, Jane Street and George Street [now respectively Jackson, Hunter, Young, and Forest Streets, as well as Charlton Avenue]. The 1851 Map of the City of Hamilton by Marcus Smith showcases all of these streets in place. Strongman Road [sometimes referred to as ""Strongman's Road""] was built by William Strongman in 1841. There are a number of maps which showcase this early access road (Ryckman, 1842; Whitefield, 1854; Blyth, 1858; among others). Central on this map is the escarpment brow with ""quarries"" depicted along the rock face. To the west of Wellington Street, between Jane Street and George Street, is the ""Orphan Asylum"". This was the original Hamilton Orphan Asylum (1848-1958). For more information on this institution, see RMC 7630 ""[Part of the Blaikie Estate]"". There are numerous landowners depicted on the map. These include the following: ""A. Carpenter, Esq.""; ""J. Cummings, Esq.""; ""H.C. Baker, Esq.""; ""J. Bradley, Esq.""; ""H. Clarke, Esq.""; ""A. O'Neill""; ""R. Patterson""; ""Sunley, Esq.""; and ""Mrs. Evans"". Alexander Carpenter (1806-1866) was a local artisan, carpenter, and pattern-maker from Saltfleet Township. He entered into industrial manufacturing in the 1840's and by 1844 he co-founded the Gurney &  Carpenter Iron Foundry (1844-1863). Carpenter was very involved in civic life in Hamilton, serving in police, fire, and political roles. Carpenter is famous for building 'Rock Castle' in 1848, his famous stone residence on the mountainside. The building outlined on this plan, perched along Akledun Avenue, is in fact 'Rock Castle' which still exists today (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., ""Carpenter, Alexander"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, Vol. I 1791-1875. Hamilton: W.L. Griffin Ltd., 1981, 42). James Cummings (1815-1894) was a businessman and politician who came to Canada from Ireland, via Montreal, in the late 1830's. Cummings sold household wares and wholesale products out of his store on King Street. In the 1851 City of Hamilton Directory, his company ""James Cummings & Co."" is listed as being ""importers of china, glass, crockery, paints, oils, turpentine, varnish, brushes, window glass, &c., wholesale and retail."" He was also the co-president of the Canada Oil Company. Cummings served as an alderman in 1854 and was later elected as mayor but then lost the position due to an invalid election. Subsequently, he served as the city tax collector until his death (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., ""Cummings, James"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, 57). Hugh Cossart Baker Sr. (1818-1859) was an English-born banker and businessman. He was the first manager of King Street's Bank of Montreal from 1842 to 1850. He co-founded the Canada Life Assurance Company and served as its president, manager, and actuary. He also founded the Ontario Marine and Fire Insurance Company and served as director of of the Hamilton Gas Light Company as well as the Gore Bank. He was very involved in business issues throughout the region, acting as an important stakeholder in the Great Western Railway, the Hamilton and Port Dover Railway, the Hamilton Board of Trade, and the Board of Arts and Manufacturers (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., ""Baker, Hugh Cossart, Sr,"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, 12-13). John Bradley (1805-1864) was a Hamilton politician and hotel owner. Born in Ireland, Bradley moved to U.S. and then to Canada in 1830. He quickly became a leader in the Irish Catholic community in Hamilton, hosting meetings at his inn (the Court House Hotel). Bradley also owned land in the central city and ran the British Hotel on John Street. Between 1837-1839 Bradley sat on the Police Board, representing Corktown (Michael Doucet and John Weaver, ""Town Fathers and Urban Continuity: The Roots of Community Power and Physical Form in Hamilton, Upper Canada in the 1830s,"" Urban History Review, 13:2, 1984). Most notably, Bradley is remembered for his handsome estate home, 'Bellevue', which he built on the mountain brow in 1849. Bellevue (also known as the Belvidere Mansion) was one of the earliest stone structures on the escarpment, in Barton Township. Bellevue was demolished in 2000. It was originally located on the western corner of Sam Lawrence Park, on what is now Belvidere Avenue. Hutchinson Clarke (1806-1877), sometimes spelled ""Clark"", was an English-born architect and contractor. Clarke came to Hamilton in 1834 and opened an office on Hughson Street. Clarke was active in politics, representing St. Andrew's Ward during the 1850's and 1860's. He also served as mayor of Hamilton in 1868 (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., ""Clark, Hutchinson,"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, 51). No definite information could be located on the other landowners listed (""A. O'Neill"", ""R. Patterson"", ""Sunley, Esq."", and ""Mrs. Evans""). The map's surveyor was John Stoughton Dennis (1820-1885). Dennis was an important surveying and military personality in Upper Canada during the 19th century. He was responsible for surveying lands across the country, including 25 subdivisions in Toronto. He became a Provincial Land Surveyor in 1842 and was appointed as Surveyor General of Canada in 1871. For more information on Dennis, see RMC 7608 (""Plan of lots I to IX both inclusive in the Vth and VIth Concessions of Saltfleet"")."

71570	cartographic	"This is a plan for property lots in central Hamilton, as originally laid out by early settlers George and Robert Hamilton. To the left of the title the map is numbered: ""No. 19 Drawer No. 2"". Below the map's title is its directional arrow which is oriented so as to point towards the base as north (upside down). Below that is the surveyor information, scale and date: ""Surveyed by the late Samuel Rykman, P.L.S., and Thos. A. Blyth P.L.S."", ""Scale: 2 chains = 1 Inch"", ""Ths. Allen Blyth P.L.S., Hamilton, August 6th 1858."" The streets listed on the map include the following: King Street, Main Street, Tyburn Street [now Jackson Street], Peel Street [now Hunter Street], Augusta Street, Catharina Street [now Young Street], Maria Street [now Forest Avenue], Hannah Street/Jane Street [now Charlton Avenue], James Street, John Street, Catherine Street, Cherry Street [now Ferguson Avenue], Morrison Street [now Foster Street], and a ""macadamized road"" [now approximately Arkledun Avenue and Claremont Access]. The other roads not labelled are Concession Street and Walnut Street (Margaret Houghton, Hamilton Street Names: An Illustrated Guide. Toronto: James Lorimer & Co. Publishers, 2002). The plan builds upon the original town plot designed by George Hamilton (1788-1836) and Nathaniel Hughson (1755-1837) in 1816. The land was purchased by the pair from James Durand (1775-1833) and, as is shown on this map, the lots were parceled into the popular grid pattern. George Hamilton gave his name to the site, which eventually became the City of Hamilton. The original plan (entitled ""Early Plan of Hamilton [1820?]"") can be viewed in Dear, Drake and Reeds (eds.) ""Steel City,"" Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987, 100. George was also the son of early settler Robert Hamilton (1753-1809), ""the chief land speculator in early Upper Canada."" At his peak, he owned a total of 130,170 acres (Bruce G. Wilson, ""Hamilton, Robert,"" Dictionary of Canadian Biography, www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hamilton_robert_5E.html). George's son was also named Robert Hamilton (1811-1892), making it unclear as to which Robert the map refers. In the top left corner of the map (just north of the escarpment base) is a ""Family Burial Ground"". This is the burial plot of the Hamilton family, one of the earliest in the city. Interred in this cemetery are George Hamilton, James Durand, and Dr. William Case (1776-1848) among others. The bodies were exhumed from the burial ground and moved to other cemeteries when the city widened the Jolley Cut during the 1950's (correspondence with historian Robin McKee, July 10, 2015). In the top right-hand corner of the map is a large parcel of land owned by ""S.B. Freeman, Esq."" Samuel Black Freeman (1814-1874) was a Hamilton lawyer who owned a practice on King Street East. He worked in partnership with both William Proudfoot and William Craigie. Freeman was also a clerk of the peace and politician who ran, unsuccessfully, against Isaac Buchanan for the assembly of the Province of Canada in 1861.  Freeman was married to Catherine Hamilton, one of the daughters of George Hamilton. Today, a portion of his land now makes up ""Freeman Place"", a street which runs east to west from Mountwood Avenue to James Street South (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., ""Freeman, Samuel Black,"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, 76). The plan also outlines the original ""hay market"" that was installed by George Hamilton in the 1830's. It is found between John and Hughson, just north of Augusta Street. Today, as a tribute, there is a small street south of the Hamilton GO rail station known as ""Haymarket Street"". The surveyors listed on the plan are ""Samuel Rykman, P.L.S.,"" and Thos. A. Blyth, P.L.S."" It appears as though Rykman was the original surveyor on Hamilton's townsite while Blyth acted as the surveyor for this particular plan. Blyth was an established surveyor in Hamilton. For more information on Blyth, see RMC 7609: ""Sketch of survey of lot 23 in the 4th Con. and lot 23 in the 5th Con., Saltfleet."" Samuel Ryckman (1777-1846) (also spelled as ""Rykman"") was a farmer and Crown land surveyor who came to Hamilton following the American Revolution. Ryckman completed surveys across Upper Canada. In payment for his surveys, Ryckman received 700 acres of land, centring on Upper James Street and Rymal Road. The hamlet of ""Ryckman's Corners"" was named after Samuel (Donna Reid and Robin McKee, ""Samuel Ryckman"" in The Hamiltonians, Margaret Houghton, ed. Toronto: James Lorimer and Co.

71571	cartographic	"This map shows a basic building plan for lots along Catherine Street, between King and King William Streets. There are a number of buildings which are shaded in yellow and brown, presumably they are the properties in question, belonging to the company Buchanan, Harris & Co. The map is numbered in the bottom left-hand corner ""No. 85 Drawer 3"". At the base of the map is the scale, drawn as a ruler up to 150 feet. The equivalent ratio for the slide is 150 feet is equal to 8 inches (18.75 feet = 1 inch). The map is similar, in many ways, to a fire insurance plan, listing the height and material constitution of each building. There are numbers written in bold on each lot which, presumably, correspond to a missing index indicating relevant property information. The company Buchanan, Harris and Co. was a large dry goods and mercantile importer based in Hamilton. The firm was a partnership of Isaac Buchanan (1810-1883), Peter Buchanan (1805-1860), Robert William Harris (1805-1861), and John Young (1808-1873). Founded in 1840, the company became extremely profitable and and was described as ""the largest mercantile house in the province."" (Douglas McCalla, ""Buchanan, Peter,"" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/buchanan_peter_8E.html). As is evidenced by the 1857-58 Hamilton City Directory, the company owned land on King Street East, presumably pointing to the same property located on this map. The company's central figure, Isaac Buchanan, originally moved to Canada in 1830 to set up an outpost of the Glasgow-based dry goods firm William Guild Jr. and Co. Isaac and his brother Peter bought out the company in 1834 and established Isaac Buchanan and Co., in Toronto and Peter Buchanan and Co., in Glasgow (H.J. Bridgman, ""Buchanan, Isaac,""in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, 31-36). After establishing Buchanan, Harris and Company in Hamilton, the partners decided to close the company branch in Toronto (ca. 1843) also opened a Montreal branch that would be run by assistant James Law. It was well known that Isaac provided the company's entrepreneurial energy while other partners Peter Buchanan and Robert Harris provided sound, long-term prudence. Isaac also often ran into contention with his partners and in 1853 both Young and Law left the firm (Douglas McCalla, ""Young, John"" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/buchanan_peter_8E.html). In 1856 Isaac recklessly used the firm's capital and all of his reserves to secretly secure rights to build a portion of the Great Western Railway to Amherstburg. The railway declined to build the southern leg and both partners were outraged. The company was pushed to near bankruptcy and both Harris and Peter Buchanan struggled to save the firm. Buchanan, Harris and Co., never fully recovered and the 1850's and 1860's proved difficult for the company. Harris was permanently injured in a riding accident and Peter Buchanan died in 1860. Isaac Buchanan was unable to adequately manage the firm on his own and died financially insolvent."

The scale is listed below the title (""Scale:-100Ft. = 1 In.""). The directional arrow is found in the upper right hand corner. The map is also numbered in the upper right hand corner: ""County No. 16."" The streets listed on the map include: ""Fifth Concession Road"" [now Fennell Avenue], ""macadamized road between lots 14 & 15"" [now Upper James Street], ""Prospect Avenue"" [now Claremont Drive], ""Clairmont Avenue"" [now Arcade Crescent], ""First Avenue"" [now approximately Inverness Court], ""Second Avenue"" [now approximately Gateview Drive], ""Third Avenue"" [now approximately Brantdale Avenue], and an unnamed road between lots 15 & 16 [now West 5th Street]. There are 78 lots parceled on this plan, including a large park known as ""Clairmont Park Reserve."" Also noted here is the ""Incline Railway Depot"" travelling down from the escarpment brow [this transportation infrastructure was designed by Tyrell]. There are numerous signatures of officials on the plan. In the top left, there is a witness statement and signature by ""Charles J. Layland"" as well as a signature by Wentworth County official: Judge Alexander Logie. Logie (1823-1873) was active in Hamilton politics, the local justice system, and local Presbyterianism. He also served as judge for the Wentworth County Court from 1854-1873. (""Alexander Logie fonds PF 59,"" in the Law Society of Upper Canada Archives, prepared 2013). In the bottom left there are signatures and a date (""Hamilton 15 Sept. 1897""). Those who gave the plan approval include: ""Watson G. Walton"", ""William Magee Jr."", and ""James Chisholm"". Chisholm (1858-1944) was an active Hamilton lawyer who enlisted in the Queen's Rifles and eventually attained the rank of Colonel. Also found on this map is a signature by George Aurey, the Acting Registrar for the County of Wentworth, and a date ""the sixteenth day of September, A.D. 1897."" Finally, in the bottom right corner is a certification statement and signature by the surveyor ""J.W. Tyrell"". James Williams Tyrell (1863-1945) was one of Canada's most prolific surveyors, explorers, and map makers during the 19th century. He practiced as an engineer and surveyor until 1893 when he embarked on an exploration into the Canadian interior with his brother Joseph Burr Tyrell (""Tyrell, James Williams,"" Historica Canada, http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/james-williams-tyrell, accessed July 10, 2015). The survey itself showcases the severance and subdividing of the property of former politician and mercantile baron Isaac Buchanan (1810-1883). Buchanan termed his illustrious estate Claremont (alternatively spelled ""Clairmont"") and it included a number of buildings including Auchmar. Buchanan purchased the land in 1852 but lost most of it to over-ambitious business maneuvers in the latter-half of the 19th century. Of note on this map, in lot 32, is a building footprint which symbolizes the ""Claremont Gatehouse"" at 71 Claremont Drive (Robert J.

71687	cartographic	"This is a plan for John Ferguson's property in central Hamilton (the plot labeled ""entailed property""). The plan does not include a date, directional arrow or scale. There are 194 subdivided lots depicted on the map surrounding Ferguson's property. At the northern extremity of the plan is the Great Western Railway running east to west. The streets listed on the map are all in existence today. They include: Cannon Street, Robert Street, Barton Street, Murray Street, Wellington Street, Cathcart Street, Ferguson Avenue, Elgin Street, and Mary Street. Circa 1858 would be the earliest the map could be dated. This is the year that Cherry Street was renamed Ferguson Avenue (W.A. Shepard, The City of Hamilton Directory, 1858). The building footprint drawn on the plan is the original Ferguson family home built by John's ancestor and of one of Hamilton's earliest settlers, Peter Ferguson (1795-1824). In 1802, Peter settled on 100 acres of land at Lot 13, Concessions 1-2. This plan outlines a portion of that originally-ceded Crown grant (Margaret Houghton, ""Ferguson Avenue,"" in Hamilton Street Names. Toronto: James Lorimer & Co., Publishers, 2002, 36). By the time of the middle of the 19th century, despite being close to the town centre of Hamilton, most of the Ferguson family land on lot 13 was still undeveloped. Peter Ferguson's son Archibald took ownership of the land following his father's death. Though the Ferguson lands were located at the eastern edge of the city, as Michael Doucet and John Weaver point out, ""[Archibald] Ferguson annoyed the Board of Police for his failure to open a street and he had a mere seven people dwelling on his 200 acres in 1839. A pioneer agrarian with a low lying farm, he was not an assertive developer with a desirable tract"" (Michael Doucet and John Weaver, ""Town Fathers and Urban Continuity,"" in Urban History Review 13:2, 1984, 81). Twelve years later, at the time of the publication of the 1851 Marcus Smith Map of the City of Hamilton, the Ferguson lands were still largely undeveloped, especially compared to the built area surrounding their farmland. There were subdivided lots to the east of Wellington Street and to the west of Mary Street. But, as mentioned Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, in 1856 the land was parceled into urban lots and developed (T. Melville Bailey, ed, ""Ferguson, Peter,"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, Vol. 1, Hamilton: W.L. Griffin Ltd., 1981, 72). The 1859 Map of the County of Wentworth by Robert Surtees confirms this fact. It shows the Ferguson tract as entirely subdivided south of Barton (Lot 13, Concession 2) while north of Barton the undeveloped the broken front marshland (which would have been difficult to build upon) was retained by Archibald. By 1876, all of the Ferguson lands were urbanized. The Wentworth County Atlas shows that the northern parcel of land was developed right up to the bay. This plan was created after this land was subdivided for the property of John Ferguson. It is possible that John subdivided and sold some of the land once he took over ownership. Very little information could be found on John Ferguson himself. It unclear whether or not John was the son or the brother of Archibald Ferguson. The 1876 Wentworth County Atlas does list John Ferguson as owning some land in Barton Township during this period."

There are 73 individual lots depicted along with two large featured lots, belonging to Hutchinson Clark (1806-1877) and the law firm Burton & Sadlier. The map features an ornate directional arrow in the top left hand corner where it is numbered: ""No. 8 Drawer 4."" Below the title, the publishing information is written ""Lith Spectator Office, Hamilton, C.W.""  Unlike most maps in this series, the scale on this map is not lexical but rather in linear, bar form with a visual ratio of 2 inches to 100 feet. This is found at the base of the map. Geographically, the plan is located in between the Keith and Landsdale neighbourhoods in the industrial district of the city. The streets listed include Alma Street, Balaclava Street, George Street, Inkerman Street, and Victoria Avenue. Today, the streets roughly correspond to Shaw Street, Clark Avenue, Ferrie Street, Burton Street, and Victoria Avenue. Clark Street was named for Hutchinson Clark and Burton Street for the founder of Burton & Sadlier, G.W. Burton. Alma, Balaclava, and Inkerman Streets are appear to be named after celebrated British engagements during the Crimean War (all in 1854). Victoria Avenue and George Street are named for famous British monarchs; Queen Victoria (1819-1901) and King George V (1865-1936). One of the central property owners featured on this map, Hutchinson Clark, was an architect and politician who served as the mayor of Hamilton in 1868. He was also responsible for designing numerous buildings throughout the city including the Mechanic's Institute on James Street (Thomas Melville Bailey ed., ""Clark, Hutchinson,"" in Dictionary of Hamilton Biography, 51). Another section of the map belonged to the law offices of Burton & Sadlier (sometimes spelled ""Sadleir"").  The 1851and 1853 City of Hamilton Directories lists Burton & Sadlier as ""barristers and attornies at law"" working out of an office on King Street East. Principal George W. Burton is listed on the Board of Directors for the Canada Life Assurance Company in 1859. They were high profile legal professionals in the city, hiring young lawyers such as John Morrison Gibson (1842-1929) in 1866. The subtitle on the map indicates that the foundry of McQuesten & Co. was located on the western side of Victoria Avenue. The company—which was originally located at the corner of James and Merrick Streets [now York Boulevard—relocated to the foot of Welllington Street, to the west of Victoria Avenue in 1855. In 1857, co-founder Calvin McQuesten (1801-1885) decided to retire and soon after the company was renamed the Sawyer and Massey Company after partners Luther Sawyer and Hart Almerrin Massey (David G.

Since Hamilton did not achieve official city status until 1846, the lots are shown as ""town lots."" Writing on the map is very faint but some details can be discerned. To the right of the title is the directional arrow indicating that the map is oriented in an upside down format. To the left of the title is a signature by the surveyor, ""Samuel Ryckman, Dept. Provl. Surveyor,"" and a date ""February 1842."" In the bottom left hand corner is found the scale: ""2 chains to one inch."" The map is also numbered in the bottom left hand corner: ""No. 24 Drawer 4."" The streets listed on the map include: John Street, James Street, Hannah Street [now Charlton Avenue], and a ""Road"" on the escarpment [now Concession Street]. The ""mountain"" figures prominently on this map, being clearly labelled and shaded. All lots (13-15) and concessions (3-4) are also labelled. The surveyor, Samuel Ryckman (1777-1846) was a Deputy Provincial Surveyor who completed surveys across Upper Canada. Ryckman (alternatively spelled ""Rykman"") was given a total of 11,042 acres in recompense for his surveying work (Randy William Widdis, ""Speculation and the Surveyor,"" in Social History (15)30:1982, 443-458). In Hamilton, Ryckman was reimbursed with 700 acres of land, centring on Upper James Street and Rymal Road. The hamlet of ""Ryckman's Corners"" was named after Samuel (Donna Reid and Robin McKee, ""Samuel Ryckman"" in The Hamiltonians, Margaret Houghton, ed. Toronto: James Lorimer and Co. Publishers, 2003). Many of the names of property owners drawn onto the map have faded, but the few that remain legible include: William Orr, R.P. Street, J.B. Freeman, and J.C. Richardson.

The streets listed are Concession Street [now Aberdeen Avenue], Queen Street, Markland Street, and Hess Street. The map maker's initials are found at the end of the title and along the left-hand margin where it reads ""Copy - C.[?]B."" There is a possibility that these are the initials of Charles Edward Booth (1821-1919). Booth was a surveyor who did professional work in Hamilton and died in the city in 1919 (Allan Davis, ""C.E.S. Booth,"" Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, Toronto: AOLS Report of the Committee on Biography & Repository, accessed August 14, 2015). In the centre of the map there are 29 lots subdivided on the property of ""John Brown, Esq."" Brown was a merchant who lived in Hamilton. Brown was active in civic life in the city. It is possible that he acted as City Chamberlain, as evidenced by the 1851 City of Hamilton Directory (W.A. Shepard, The City of Hamilton Directory, 1851). In 1861, Brown built an elegant estate on Aberdeen Avenue (between Bay and Ravenscliffe) known as Highfield. The property was converted into the Highfield School for Boys in 1901; a predecessor to Hillfield Strathallan College (""History of HSC,"" Hillfield Strathallan College, http://www.hsc.on.ca/discover/history-of-hsc, accessed August 14, 2015). Brown was, also, at one point an owner of the famous hillside mansion ""Rock Castle"" (1848) built by Alexander Carpenter. In the 1871 Canadian Census, John Brown is listed as being 47 years old and a ""wholesale merchant."""

The map is oriented upside down, with the directional arrow pointing to the bottom of the map. The map is without an official title although later writing along the left hand side has given it the title of ""Old Race Course."" It is also numbered along the left hand side: ""No. 20 Drawer 3."" The scale is located at the base of the map: ""Scale 3chs or 19sft to one Inch,"" along with the surveyor information: ""Thos. A. Blyth P.L.S., Hamilton, Nov. 25th 1872."" Blyth was a very well known surveyor in Hamilton during the Victoria era. For more information on Blyth, see RMC 7609: ""Sketch of survey of lot 23 in the 4th Con. and lot 23 in the 5th Con., Saltfleet."" The boundaries of the map are Main Street to the north,  ""the fourth concession and south limits of City of Hamilton,"" [now Aberdeen Ave] to the south, ""Lock Street"" [now Locke Street] to the east, and ""Road allowance between no. 18 and 19,"" [now Dundurn Street]. Other streets shown on the map include: Poulette, Robert [now Bold], Wentworth [now Jackson], Canada, William [now Hunter], Duke, Robinson, ""Maple or Anderson"" [now Charlton], Herkimer, Markland, and South [now non-existent]. There are two small parcels on the plan belonging to ""M. Fanning"" and ""T. Coyle,"" found at the northeast corner of Locke and Duke Streets. Today there is small side street known as Fanning Street in this location. To the west of Poulette Street it reads ""The Beasley Survey."" The majority of the land on the plan originally belonged to Richard Beasley (1761-1842). Beasley was one of the earliest settlers in the Hamilton area and acquired the land from Anne Morden (1743-1832) sometime after the War of 1812. It is unclear as to when Beasley had the race track built but the 1850-51 Map of the City of Hamilton by Marcus Smith shows the grounds when they were in operation. The 1859 Map of Hamilton by Robert Surtees also shows this lot labeled as the ""race course"" lot. The 1878 County Atlas map showed ""cricket grounds"" situated here. Given that Blyth's plan was completed in 1872, it is evident that the land was not subdivided for housing until some years later. Copp, Clark & Co.'s Map of the City of Hamilton shows the race track removed and the urban grid pattern in place by 1882."
