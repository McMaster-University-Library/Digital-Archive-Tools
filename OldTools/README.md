# Digital Archive Tools: Old Tools

Digital Archive Tools is a resource to perform web analytics on the Library's Digital Archive of map and data collections, collecting and reporting web data through the use of Google Analytics.

## Tool: Scraper.py

This python script creates a lookup table of a specific range of objects on the Digital Archive. This output table of web pages is then the list of objects we will perform web analytics on. It outputs the object's MacRepo ID, URL, page title, and distinguishes the object as a collection or item in the csv file labelled Macrepo_Lookup.csv. Note that the Macrepo_Lookup.csv file stored in the Digital-Archive-Tools folder is created from a run through of Scraper_V2.py, as it contains additional content as described previously.

## Tool: Scraper_AAB.py

This python script creates a lookup table of a specific range of objects on the Digital Archive, particularly the archives and books collections. It outputs the object's MacRepo ID, URL, page title, and distinguishes the object as a collection or item in the csv file labelled Macrepo_Lookup_AAB.csv.
