    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(id)</code>
  <pre>Delete a raster.

Args:
  id: string, The ID of the raster. Only the raster creator or project owner are permitted to delete. If the raster is included in a layer or mosaic, the request will fail. Remove it from all parents prior to deleting. (required)
