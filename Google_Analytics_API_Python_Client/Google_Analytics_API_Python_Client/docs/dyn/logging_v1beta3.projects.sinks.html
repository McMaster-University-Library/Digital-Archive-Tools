<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(projectsId, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a project sink. A logs filter determines which log entries are written to the destination.

Args:
  projectsId: string, Part of `projectName`. The resource name of the project to which the sink is bound. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes where log entries are written outside of Cloud Logging.
    "filter": "A String", # An advanced logs filter. If present, only log entries matching the filter are written. Only project sinks use this field; log sinks and log service sinks must not include a filter.
    "errors": [ # _Output only._ If any errors occur when invoking a sink method, then this field contains descriptions of the errors.
      { # Describes a problem with a logging resource or operation.
        "status": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments. Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons. # The error description, including a classification code, an error message, and other details.
          "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the [google.rpc.Status.details][google.rpc.Status.details] field, or localized by the client.
          "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][].
          "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There will be a common set of message types for APIs to use.
            {
              "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @ype with type URL.
            },
          ],
        },
        "timeNanos": "A String", # The time the error was observed, in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.
        "resource": "A String", # A resource name associated with this error. For example, the name of a Cloud Storage bucket that has insufficient permissions to be a destination for log entries.
      },
    ],
    "destination": "A String", # The resource name of the destination. Cloud Logging writes designated log entries to this destination. For example, `"storage.googleapis.com/my-output-bucket"`.
    "name": "A String", # The client-assigned name of this sink. For example, `"my-syslog-sink"`. The name must be unique among the sinks of a similar kind in the project.
  }
