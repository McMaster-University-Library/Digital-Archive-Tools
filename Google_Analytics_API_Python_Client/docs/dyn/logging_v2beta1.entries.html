  <pre>Lists log entries. Use this method to retrieve log entries from Cloud Logging. For ways to export log entries, see [Exporting Logs](/logging/docs/export).

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The parameters to `ListLogEntries`.
    "orderBy": "A String", # Optional. How the results should be sorted. Presently, the only permitted values are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first option returns entries in order of increasing values of `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option returns entries in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first). Entries with equal timestamps are returned in order of `LogEntry.insertId`.
    "pageSize": 42, # Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request. You must check for presence of `nextPageToken` to determine if additional results are available, which you can retrieve by passing the `nextPageToken` value as the `pageToken` parameter in the next request.
    "partialSuccess": True or False, # Optional. If true, read access to all projects is not required and results will be returned for the subset of projects for which read access is permitted (empty subset is permitted).
    "filter": "A String", # Optional. An [advanced logs filter](/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters). The filter is compared against all log entries in the projects specified by `projectIds`. Only entries that match the filter are retrieved. An empty filter matches all log entries.
    "pageToken": "A String", # Optional. If the `pageToken` parameter is supplied, then the next page of results is retrieved. The `pageToken` parameter must be set to the value of the `nextPageToken` from the previous response. The values of `projectIds`, `filter`, and `orderBy` must be the same as in the previous request.
    "projectIds": [ # Required. One or more project IDs or project numbers from which to retrieve log entries. Examples of a project ID: `"my-project-1A"`, `"1234567890"`.
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Result returned from `ListLogEntries`.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # If there are more results than were returned, then `nextPageToken` is included in the response. To get the next set of results, call this method again using the value of `nextPageToken` as `pageToken`.
    "projectIdErrors": { # If partial_success is true, contains the project ids that had errors and the associated errors.
      "a_key": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments. Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
