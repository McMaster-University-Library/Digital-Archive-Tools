<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(id, body)</code>
  <pre>Remove rasters from an existing raster collection.

Up to 50 rasters can be included in a single batchDelete request. Each batchDelete request is atomic.

Args:
  id: string, The ID of the raster collection to which these rasters belong. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to rasterCollections.Rasters.BatchDelete.
    "ids": [ # An array of Raster asset IDs to be removed from this RasterCollection.
      "A String",
    ],
  }


Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response returned by a call to rasterCollections.rasters.batchDelete.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchInsert">batchInsert(id, body)</code>
  <pre>Add rasters to an existing raster collection. Rasters must be successfully processed in order to be added to a raster collection.

Up to 50 rasters can be included in a single batchInsert request. Each batchInsert request is atomic.

Args:
  id: string, The ID of the raster collection to which these rasters belong. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to rasterCollections.Rasters.BatchInsert.
    "ids": [ # An array of Raster asset IDs to be added to this RasterCollection.
      "A String",
    ],
  }


Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response returned by a call to rasterCollections.rasters.batchInsert.
  }</pre>
</div>

    <code class="details" id="list">list(id, modifiedBefore=None, creatorEmail=None, pageToken=None, role=None, createdAfter=None, tags=None, maxResults=None, bbox=None, modifiedAfter=None, search=None, createdBefore=None)</code>
  <pre>Return all rasters within a raster collection.

Args:
  id: string, The ID of the raster collection to which these rasters belong. (required)
  modifiedBefore: string, An RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Returned assets will have been modified at or before this time.
  creatorEmail: string, An email address representing a user. Returned assets that have been created by the user associated with the provided email address.
  pageToken: string, The continuation token, used to page through large result sets. To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of nextPageToken from the previous response.
  role: string, The role parameter indicates that the response should only contain assets where the current user has the specified level of access.
    Allowed values
      owner - The user can read, write and administer the asset.
      reader - The user can read the asset.
      writer - The user can read and write the asset.
  createdAfter: string, An RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Returned assets will have been created at or after this time.
  tags: string, A comma separated list of tags. Returned assets will contain all the tags from the list.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of items to include in a single response page. The maximum supported value is 100.
  bbox: string, A bounding box, expressed as "west,south,east,north". If set, only assets which intersect this bounding box will be returned.
  modifiedAfter: string, An RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Returned assets will have been modified at or after this time.
  search: string, An unstructured search string used to filter the set of results based on asset metadata.
