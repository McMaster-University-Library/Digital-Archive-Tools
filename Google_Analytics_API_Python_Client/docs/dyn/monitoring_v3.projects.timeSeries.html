  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method.

  <pre>Lists time series that match a filter. This method does not require a Stackdriver account.

Args:
  name: string, The project on which to execute the request. The format is "projects/{project_id_or_number}". (required)
  orderBy: string, Specifies the order in which the points of the time series should be returned. By default, results are not ordered. Currently, this field must be left blank.
  pageSize: integer, A positive number that is the maximum number of results to return. When `view` field sets to `FULL`, it limits the number of `Points` server will return; if `view` field is `HEADERS`, it limits the number of `TimeSeries` server will return.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
  aggregation_alignmentPeriod: string, The alignment period for per-[time series](TimeSeries) alignment. If present, `alignmentPeriod` must be at least 60 seconds. After per-time series alignment, each time series will contain data points only on the period boundaries. If `perSeriesAligner` is not specified or equals `ALIGN_NONE`, then this field is ignored. If `perSeriesAligner` is specified and does not equal `ALIGN_NONE`, then this field must be defined; otherwise an error is returned.
  pageToken: string, If this field is not empty then it must contain the `nextPageToken` value returned by a previous call to this method. Using this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous method call.
  aggregation_groupByFields: string, The set of fields to preserve when `crossSeriesReducer` is specified. The `groupByFields` determine how the time series are partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation function. Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly one subset. The `crossSeriesReducer` is applied to each subset of time series. Fields not specified in `groupByFields` are aggregated away. If `groupByFields` is not specified, the time series are aggregated into a single output time series. If `crossSeriesReducer` is not defined, this field is ignored. (repeated)
  aggregation_perSeriesAligner: string, The approach to be used to align individual time series. Not all alignment functions may be applied to all time series, depending on the metric type and value type of the original time series. Alignment may change the metric type or the value type of the time series. Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If `crossSeriesReducer` is specified, then `perSeriesAligner` must be specified and not equal `ALIGN_NONE` and `alignmentPeriod` must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
  interval_endTime: string, Required. The end of the interval. The interval includes this time.
  aggregation_crossSeriesReducer: string, The approach to be used to combine time series. Not all reducer functions may be applied to all time series, depending on the metric type and the value type of the original time series. Reduction may change the metric type of value type of the time series. Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If `crossSeriesReducer` is specified, then `perSeriesAligner` must be specified and not equal `ALIGN_NONE` and `alignmentPeriod` must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
  filter: string, A [monitoring filter](/monitoring/api/v3/filters) that specifies which time series should be returned. The filter must specify a single metric type, and can additionally specify metric labels and other information. For example: metric.type = "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time" AND metric.label.instance_name = "my-instance-name"
  interval_startTime: string, If this value is omitted, the interval is a point in time, `endTime`. If `startTime` is present, it must be earlier than (less than) `endTime`. The interval begins after `startTime`â€”it does not include `startTime`.
  view: string, Specifies which information is returned about the time series.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as disks. The `type` field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the resource's schema. Information in the `labels` field identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema.
