<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(projectId, zone, clusterId, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a node pool for a cluster.

Args:
  projectId: string, The Google Developers Console [project ID or project number](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#projectnumber). (required)
  zone: string, The name of the Google Compute Engine [zone](/compute/docs/zones#available) in which the cluster resides. (required)
  clusterId: string, The name of the cluster. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # CreateNodePoolRequest creates a node pool for a cluster.
    "nodePool": { # NodePool contains the name and configuration for a cluster's node pool. Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM's), with a common configuration and specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to accommodate the workload. # The node pool to create.
      "status": "A String", # The status of the nodes in this pool instance.
      "statusMessage": "A String", # [Output only] Additional information about the current status of this node pool instance, if available.
