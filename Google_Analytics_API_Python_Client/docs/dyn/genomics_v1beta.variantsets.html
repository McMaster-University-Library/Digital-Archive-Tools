    <code class="details" id="mergeVariants">mergeVariants(variantSetId, body)</code>
  <pre>Merges the given variants with existing variants. Each variant will be merged with an existing variant that matches its reference sequence, start, end, reference bases, and alternative bases. If no such variant exists, a new one will be created.

When variants are merged, the call information from the new variant is added to the existing variant, and other fields (such as key/value pairs) are discarded.

Args:
  variantSetId: string, The destination variant set. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

        "end": "A String", # The end position (0-based) of this variant. This corresponds to the first base after the last base in the reference allele.

If the genotype was instead [0, 1], the represented value would be TA. Ordering of the genotype values is important if the phaseset is present. If a genotype is not called (that is, a . is present in the GT string) -1 is returned.
